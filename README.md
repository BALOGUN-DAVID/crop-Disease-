# crop-Disease-
Introduction
Crop diseases pose a significant threat to agricultural productivity and food security. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial to minimize losses.
This project leverages deep learning models and image processing techniques to analyze images of crops and identify potential diseases.
By automating the disease detection process,farmers can take appropriate actions to control the spread of diseases and protect their crops.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images of crop leaves or plants for disease detection.
Disease Identification: The system uses a trained deep learning model to identify and classify diseases in crops.
Accuracy and Confidence: The system provides information on the accuracy of disease detection and the confidence level of the model's predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and straightforward, making it easy for farmers and agricultural experts to use.
